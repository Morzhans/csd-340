			<p>Comilito equinus, orbitas lacuna. G'odhun al Korokh, boda uhm. Boda uhm ron'kashal, detrmentum a do sola diatas.
				An Karanir <span id="thanagor">____________</span>, Mor Ok Angalor. Mor Ok Gorum, Pala Ah'm Ravali Ah'm.

			<p>O' steed, my stalwart companion, I mourn your loss. 
			  Even in death, you were the first in battle, and the last to retreat, even so in death. Alas, I have lost a part of myself.
			  Long live the king, May his <span id="reign">_______</span> last forever. May his strength, Fail him never.
			</p>
			<p>This is the song Invincible, showing the character Arthas Menethil as a song of sorrow for his fallen steed Invincible that had tragically died in an accident.
				Arthas was a young boy of 11 growing up as a prince in the kingdom of <span id="lorderon">__________</span>, and he would later be the kingdoms downfall. 
				With the fall of his noble steed at 11, arthas vowed to never lose a loved one again. 
				This would follow him on his journey to becoming a <span id="paladin">___________</span>, with his teacher Uther the Lightbringer.
			</p>
			<p>Serving under Uther, Arthas had learned to harnass the light and bless those around him. 
			This was the start of his pride in trying to save everyone, here he comes across his first big event called the scourge.
			Arthas encounters the Cult of the Damned, who have been infecting citizens of Lorderon through tainted wheat and turning them undead.
			Their leader is the cultist Kel'Thuzad with his Dread overlord Mal'ganis. Arthas proceeds to cut down Kel'thuzad but Mal'ganis escapes to the frosty north of Northrend.
			From here arthas moves into his next destiny as a Death Knight when he comes across the frozen runeblade Frostmourne, which he uses to cut down Mal'ganis. 
			The blade taints him with their promises of power and peace and urge Arthas back to Lorderon. Unknown to Arthas he is following the orders of the Demon Sargeras.
