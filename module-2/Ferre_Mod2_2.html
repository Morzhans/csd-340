		<h2>Cody's Favorite Hobby</h2>
		<p class="intro"> My name is Cody Ferre and I have an interesting hobby that not many people would enjoy. 
		 <span class="sentence"> My hobby is to practice Herpetology, which is the study of reptiles and amphibians.</span>
		   How I practice this is by going out into Florida's nature areas and just hunting for reptiles I find.
		   When I do find one, its fun to look, identify, catch and even inspect them to see what kind of life they are living.</p>
		<p>Here in Florida we have so many species of reptiles that it really makes the hobby a lot of fun. 
		   With upwards of 40 different species of snakes, 56 species of turtles, and many species of lizard.
		   My favorite species to come across are snakes though, when it comes to finding one, it makes my whole day.</p>
		<p>What really makes finding a snake so enjoyable is their personalities that each species has.
		   An example of a species with a great personality is the Eastern Hognose, these guys have a snout shaped like a pig.
		   They use this snout to dig and shovel dirt but the cool personality of these guys is that they love playing dead.
		   When I come across one, it will huff, puff, flatten out and then when you reach for it. It will roll over and stick its long black tougne out.</p>
		<p>My hobby doesn't take much time with how Florida is but many people definitely don't like the idea of it.
		   When I am at work at Disney, I tend to see that more often as we get plenty of Black Racer's slithering all around.
		   A Black Racer is just an all black snake with red eyes and a white underbelly, they live up to their name by the speed they run away at.</p>
